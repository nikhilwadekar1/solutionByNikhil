1) While logging in with username=user1@gmail.com and password=user1ABC,
Repository method was returning 2 identical records from database with
same login parameters.


2) The database entries that are being hard coded at launching of application
was sending duplicate entries to database for user1@gmail.com,which was causing issue.


3) To make database entries unique,I  changed the insert query in >db/changelog/db.changelog-1.0.xml
file,so the database will have only unique login credentials(LOGIN_ID) for users. 

4) I have added unique constraint to login_id field, so that two duplicate entries cannot be cannot be added while signing up. 

5) I have also added custom exception handler to gracefully handle the exceptions.
